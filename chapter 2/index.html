    1. What are variables ? what is the difference brtween them?
    <br/>
    Variables are containers for storing data values. They are created when a program runs, and they have a memory location assigned to them. They can be declared with a specific data type, and their values can be changed.
    <br/>
    Difference between variables:
    <br/>
    - Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, meaning they don't need to be declared with a specific data type.
    <br/>
    - Variables in JavaScript can be declared anywhere in the code, and their scope is determined by the location of their declaration
    <br/>
    <br/>

    2. What is the difference between var , const and let?
    <br/>
    Ans:-var, const, and let are used to declare variables in JavaScript.
    <br/>
    - var: It is a function-scoped variable, meaning it is visible within the function in which it is declared. It has a global scope if it is not declared inside a function.
    <br/>
    - const: It is a block-scoped variable, meaning it is visible within the block in which it is declared. It cannot be reassigned once it is declared.
    <br/>
    - let: It is a block-scoped variable, meaning it is visible within the block in which it is declared. It can be reassigned.
    <br/>
    <script>
        // var example
        var a =20
        var a = 30
        function example(){
            if(true){
                var count =10;
                console.log(count); // Output: 10
            }
        }
        example();
        // console.log(count)not defined
        console.log(a) //30
        
        // const example
        const b = 20
        // b = 30; // This will throw an error
        
        // let example
        let c = 20
        c = 30
        console.log(c) // Output: 30
    </script>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    3.what are data types in js?
    <br/>
    Ans:-A data type determines the type of the variable
    <br/>
    <br/>
    4.What are the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?
    <br/>
    Ans:-Primitive data types are immutable (cannot be changed once they are created) and include: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol
    <br/>
    primitive data types can hold only single value
    <br/>
    ere the new value is stored in other memory address
    <script>
        let age=25;
        age=30
        // here the new value is stored in other memory address
    </script>
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Non-primitive data types are mutable (can be changed once they are created) and include: object, array, function
    <br/>
    Non-primitive data types can hold multiple values
    <script>
        let person = {name: "John", age: 30};
        person.age=35
        // here the new value is stored in the same memory address
    </script>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    5. what is the difference between null and undefined in js?
    <br/>
    Ans:-Null is an object that has been intentionally created as "empty" or "nothing"
    <br/>
    undefined is a variable that has not been assigned a value
    <br/>

    <script>
        let d;
        console.log(d) // Output: undefined
        a=null;
        console.log(d) // Output: null
    </script>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    6. what is the difference between == and === in js?
    <br/>
    Ans:- == checks value 
    <br/>
    === checks value, type
    <br/>
    <br/>


    7. what is the use of typeOf opeartor?
    <br/>
    Ans:-typeof operator is used to check the type of a variable
    <br/>
    <script>
        let e = 20;
        console.log(typeof e) // Output: number
        let f = "hello";
        console.log(typeof f) // Output: string
        let g = true;
        console.log(typeof g) // Output: boolean
        let h = null;
        console.log(typeof h) // Output: object
        let i = undefined;
        console.log(typeof i) // Output: undefined
        let j = function(){};
        console.log(typeof j) // Output: function
    </script>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    8. what is the type corrcion in js?
    <br/>
    Ans:-Type coercion is the automatic conversion of one data type to another data type
    <br/>
    <script>
        let k = 20 + "20";
        console.log(k) // Output: "2020"

        let l = 20 + true;
        console.log(l) // Output: 21

        let m = "hello" + 20;
        console.log(m) // Output: "hello20"

        let n = "hello" + true;
        console.log(n) // Output: "hellotrue"

        let o = 20 + null;
        console.log(o) // Output: 20

        let p = 20 + undefined;
        console.log(p) // Output: NaN

        let q = "hello" + null;
        console.log(q) // Output: "hellonull"

        let r = "hello" + undefined;
        console.log(r) // Output: "helloundefined"

        let s = 20 + function(){};
        console.log(s) // Output: "20function (){}"

        let t = "hello" + function(){};
        console.log(t) // Output: "hellofunction (){}"

        let u = 20 + {};
        console.log(u) // Output: "20[object Object]"

        let v = "hello" + {};
        console.log(v) // Output: "hello[object Object]"

        let w = 20 + [];
        console.log(w) // Output: "20"

        let x = "hello" + [];
        console.log(x) // Output: "hello"


    </script>
